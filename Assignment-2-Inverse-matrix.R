## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(solveMatrix) inv <<- solveMatrix
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}

##the matrix from makeCacheMatrix are cached inverse.
# The following function returns the inverse of the matrix. It first checks if
# the inverse has already been computed. If so, it gets the result and skips the
# computation. If not, it computes the inverse, sets the value in the cache via
# setinverse function.

# This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
